# LabVIEW_Eval
Simple Numerical Infix evaluation written in LabVIEW

This Repo contains a few things:
- An Eval.vi (currently part of a Eval.lib) This contains all of the stuff you probably want in a single vi. (you might have to grab functions.vi too)
- The Eval.vi + Libray Folder (contains Eval.lib) Has some extra stuff for efficent execution.
- The whole project this project has stuff to help extend the function of the evaluator. (if you want extra functionality try this).
